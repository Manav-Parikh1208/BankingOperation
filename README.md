Bank Operation System Program:

This C program simulates a simple bank operation system. It allows users to perform various banking operations such as creating accounts, verifying accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking balances. The program is menu-driven, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the bank system.

Key Features:

1. Structure: The program defines a structure called `acc` to represent a bank account. This structure contains three fields: account name, account holder's password, and balance.

2. Pointer: Functions in the program accept pointers to the array of accounts and modify the array's contents. This allows functions to manipulate the account data effectively.

3. Array: An array of `s` structures is used to store multiple accounts. This array serves as the database for managing accounts within the bank system.

4. Array of Objects: The `s` array is an array of `acc` objects, where each object represents a bank account. This approach enables the program to handle multiple accounts efficiently.

5. Menu-Driven Interface: The program presents a menu to the user, displaying various banking options. Users can input their choice using numeric options provided in the menu. This menu-driven approach enhances user experience and makes the program easy to navigate.

Banking Operations:

- Create Account: Allows users to create a new bank account by providing account details such as account number and account holder name. The program ensures that the maximum number of accounts doesn't exceed the defined limit.

- Verify Account: Enables users to verify the existence of a bank account by entering the account number. The program searches through the list of accounts to find a matching account number and provides appropriate feedback.

- Deposit: Facilitates depositing money into a specified bank account. Users can input the account number and the amount to be deposited. The program updates the account balance accordingly.

- Withdraw: Supports withdrawing money from a specified bank account. Users need to input the account number and the withdrawal amount. The program validates whether the account has sufficient balance before processing the withdrawal.

- Check Balance: Allows users to check the balance of a specified bank account. Users need to input the account number, and the program retrieves and displays the current balance associated with that account.

Conclusion:

In summary, this C program implements a basic bank operation system using concepts of structures, pointers, arrays, and a menu-driven interface. It provides essential functionalities for managing bank accounts and performing common banking operations efficiently. This program can be further expanded and enhanced to incorporate additional features as per specific requirements.
